We will start with an introduction to AMP and we will see how it is different compared to PWA and other JS frameworks. Because both PWA and AMP are all about faster loading of web apps. So it's good to have a clear idea on when to use AMP and when to use PWA. Later we will cover important parts of AMP like AMP HTML, AMP JS and AMP Cache. We will also see components available with AMP and how you can start building with AMP. At last we will quickly go through success stories of AMP and see how it has changed the mobile web industry.",
